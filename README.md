## CONTENTS

### General features

### Footer with social media icons

I used font awesome to design the icon of the 4 social media icons found on the footer of the website.

### Nav bar

The nav bar features the menu on the header and will help the end users to navigate easily while on the site.A smooth transition dropdown menu enhances the user experience and adds visual appeal, hence the use of bar-icon from font awesome to design the menu bar. 

To maximize compatibility, I converted the original Jpg images to a Webp file using Pixelied. This, in my opinion, should cover all feasible accepted file types across all platforms. 

The favicon was generated in GIMP 2.10.36 and exported as.ico files for compatibility.

### Fonts

I used the google fonts Roboto-Condensed and Ubuntu-Condensed because they are professional fonts used by web designers for technical layouts and economical use of space in layouts.

### wireframe
