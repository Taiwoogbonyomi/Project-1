## CONTENTS

This section explains the various features of the website and will help the end users to navigate easily while on the site. Media queries to adjust the website to all screen sizes has been used. Larger screen content can be reduced in size using flexbox so that it fits better in columns rather than rows in a layout. My media query seemed to be the optimal choice for the user experience when I ran it on Chrome and added a break point for screen widths smaller than 1000 pixels.
